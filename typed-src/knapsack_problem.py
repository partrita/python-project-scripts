"""
This program uses a genetic algorithm to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem.
In the Knapsack problem, you are given a set of items, each with a value and a weight,
and a knapsack with a weight limit. The goal is to select a combination of items
to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight limit.
This genetic algorithm iteratively evolves a population of candidate solutions to find the best combination.

Knapsack Problem Parameters:
- weight_limit: The weight limit of the knapsack.
- item_list: A list of items, where each item is represented as (value, weight).

Genetic Algorithm Parameters:
- population_size: The size of the population.
- max_generations: The maximum number of generations to run.
- mutation_rate: The probability of mutation for each gene in the chromosome.
- chromosome_length: The number of genes in each chromosome.
